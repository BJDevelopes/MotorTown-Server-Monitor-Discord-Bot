## 🏙️ Server Monitor Feature
The bot includes a real-time server monitor that automatically creates and maintains a status dashboard in a designated Discord channel.

### Features
* **Auto-Setup**: The bot automatically sends its own monitor message on the first run; no manual message ID copying is required.
* **Persistence**: Saves message data to `monitor_data.json` to ensure it resumes editing the same message after a restart.
* **Offline Tracking**: If the game server goes down, the embed turns red and displays the **Last Seen Online** timestamp.
* **Efficient**: Updates every 60 seconds using a compact layout designed for high-population servers.

### ⚙️ Configuration
Add these variables to your `.env` file to enable the monitor:

```bash
# The ID of the Discord channel where the monitor message will live
MONITOR_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678

# The name of your server as it should appear in the title
SERVER_NAME=Bjs Motor Town

# (Optional) Link to your community or server logo

## 🎮 Player Mapping

Link game player IDs to Discord users for easy identification:

```env
PLAYER_MAPPING=12345:120343643381956608|67890:987654321098765432
```

**Features:**
- Automatic Discord username lookup
- Server nickname priority (shows the name they use in your Discord)
- Multi-server support (different nicknames per server)
- Fallback to username if no nickname set

**Example:**

Without mapping:
```
Player_12345
ID: 12345
```

With mapping:
```
Jerry (Player_12345)  ← Shows their Discord server nickname!
ID: 12345
```

See [Player Mapping Guide](docs/PLAYER_MAPPING.md) for detailed setup.
